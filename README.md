# .NET performance profiler

The idea of the project is to create free alternative for commercial .NET profilers. Fast and convenient tool for .NET performance profiling, execution tracking (timeline) and exceptions monitoring. 
Current version of performance profiler is tracing. Tracing profiling is most detailed profiling type - it allows to catch every method call with high resolution.
The profiler also collects information about created appdomains, loaded assemblies, modules, classes, functions, created threads and thrown exceptions.


NOTE: to build source code you need Visual Studion 2013.
